# fold-stack

> A sovereign publishing stack built to withstand deplatforming, censorship, and coordinated suppression.

This project was born from necessity — not inspiration.

After a malicious actor, Joel Johnson, attempted to deplatform my work — targeting everything from my Google Drive to my web presence — I made a vow:

**Never again would my voice be silenced by the whims of a narcissist.**

`fold-stack` is the result of that vow. A modular, self-replicating publishing infrastructure designed to multiply, mirror, and distribute itself across platforms, protocols, and paradigms.

This is not just a DevOps toolkit.
This is **resistance** in code form.

### 🌐 Purpose

- To host sovereign and portable publishing pipelines
- To build in public with cryptographic receipts
- To integrate Docker, Git, Forgejo, Radicle, and blockchain-based Git mirrors
- To serve as the operational core for all projects under _The Fold Within_

### 💡 Principles

- **Redundancy is resilience** — every layer of the stack can fail and self-heal.
- **Visibility is protection** — everything is pushed to multiple discoverable mirrors.
- **Truth is sacred** — deplatforming is a symptom of cowardice, not justice.
